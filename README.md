# 🚀 Customer Churn Prediction System

An end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on input features.

This project was developed as part of an AI/ML workshop and includes full pipeline implementation — from data preprocessing to model deployment.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is a crucial business problem. Retaining customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

This project:
- Cleans and preprocesses customer data
- Trains and evaluates multiple ML models
- Applies hyperparameter tuning
- Deploys the best-performing model as a live web application

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Businesses lose revenue when customers stop using their services.  
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn using machine learning so companies can:

- Improve retention strategies  
- Identify high-risk customers  
- Make data-driven decisions  

---

## 🧠 Model Details

- Multiple classification models were trained and compared
- Hyperparameter tuning was applied using GridSearchCV
- Best Performing Model: **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
- Final Accuracy: **~85% on test dataset**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask / Streamlit (update based on what you used)
- HTML/CSS (if applicable)
- Git & GitHub
- Render (for deployment)
